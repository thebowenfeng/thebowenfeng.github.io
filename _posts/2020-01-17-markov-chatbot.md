Nowadays there are many sophisticated ways to approach NLP, most of them involves
neural networks. For example, OpenAI's GPT2 has achieved phenomenonal results in NLP
and can be used in a variety of fields.

However, can something as simple as Markov Chains compete with sophisticated techniques
like RNNs, or even better, GPT-2? *Hint: It can't but I thought it was interesting*

## What are markov chains?
